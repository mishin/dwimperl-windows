=head1 NAME

milla - wrapper for Milla profile

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<milla> is a command line wrapper for L<Dist::Milla>. It's a wrapper
for C<dzil>, but with overriding default arguments for some commands
such as C<new>, C<release> and C<install>.

Specifically:

=over 4

=item *

C<milla new> is equivalent to C<dzil new -P Milla>

=item *

C<milla install> is equivalent to C<dzil install --install-command="cpanm .">

=item *

C<milla release> is equivalent to C<DZIL_CONFIRMRELEASE_DEFAULT=1 dzil release>

=back

Other commands would behave exactly the same as C<dzil>.
