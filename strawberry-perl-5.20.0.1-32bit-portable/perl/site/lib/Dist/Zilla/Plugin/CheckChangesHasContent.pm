=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangesHasContent - Ensure Changes has content before releasing

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in dist.ini

  [CheckChangesHasContent]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "before release" Dist::Zilla plugin that ensures that your Changes
file actually has some content since the last release.  If it doesn't find any,
it will abort the release process.

This can be contrasted to L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ChangesHasContent>, which
generates a test to perform the check.

The algorithm is very naive.  It looks for an unindented line starting with
the version to be released.  It then looks for any text from that line until
the next unindented line (or the end of the file), ignoring whitespace.

For example, in the file below, algorithm will find "- blah blah blah":

  Changes file for Foo-Bar

  {{$NEXT}}

    - blah blah blah

  0.001  Wed May 12 13:49:13 EDT 2010

    - the first release

If you had nothing but whitespace between C<{{$NEXT}}> and C<0.001>,
the release would be halted.

If you name your change log something other than "Changes", you can configure
the name with the C<changelog> argument:

  [CheckChangesHasContent]
  changelog = ChangeLog
