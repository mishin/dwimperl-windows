=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeAnyFromPod - Automatically convert POD to a README in any format for Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 0.150250

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>

    [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
    ; Default is plaintext README in build dir

    ; Using non-default options: POD format with custom filename in
    ; dist root, outside of build. Including this README in version
    ; control makes Github happy.
    [ReadmeAnyFromPod / ReadmePodInRoot]
    type = pod
    filename = README.pod
    location = root

    ; Using plugin name autodetection: Produces README.html in root
    [ ReadmeAnyFromPod / HtmlInRoot ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates a README for your L<Dist::Zilla> powered dist from its
C<main_module> in any of several formats. The generated README can be
included in the build or created in the root of your dist for e.g.
inclusion into version control.

=head2 PLUGIN NAME AUTODETECTION

If you give the plugin an appropriate name (a string after the slash)
in your dist.ini, it will can parse the C<type> and C<location>
attributes from it. The format is "Readme[TYPE]In[LOCATION]". The
words "Readme" and "In" are optional, and the whole name is
case-insensitive. The SYNOPSIS section above gives one example.

When run with C<location = dist>, this plugin runs in the C<FileMunger> phase
to create the new file. If it runs before another C<FileMunger> plugin does,
that happens to modify the input pod (like, say,
L<C<[PodWeaver]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver>), the README file contents
will be recalculated, along with a warning that you should modify your
F<dist.ini> by referencing C<[ReadmeAnyFromPod]> lower down in the file (the
build still works, but is less efficient).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 type

The file format for the readme. Supported types are "text",
"markdown", "pod", and "html".  Note that you are not advised to
create a F<.pod> file in the dist itself, as L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>
will install that, both into C<PERL5LIB> and C<MAN3DIR>.

=head2 filename

The file name of the README file to produce. The default depends on
the selected format.

=head2 source_filename

The file from which to extract POD for the content of the README. The
default is the file of the main module of the dist. If the main module
has a companion ".pod" file with the same basename, that is used as
the default instead.

=head2 location

Where to put the generated README file. Choices are:

=over 4

=item build

This puts the README in the directory where the dist is currently
being built, where it will be incorporated into the dist.

=item root

This puts the README in the root directory (the same directory that
contains F<dist.ini>). The README will not be incorporated into the
built dist.

=back

If you want to generate the same README file in both the build
directory and the root directory, simply generate it in the build
directory and use the
L<C<[CopyFilesFromBuild]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyFilesFromBuild>
plugin to copy it to the dist root.

=head2 phase

At what phase to generate the README file. Choices are:

=over 4

=item build

(Default) This generates the README at 'after build' time. A new
README will be generated each time you build the dist.

=item release

This generates the README at 'after release' time. Note that this is
too late to get the file into the generated tarball, and is therefore
incompatible with C<location = build>. However, this is ideal if you
are using C<location = root> and only want to update the README upon
each release of your module.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 gather_files

We create the file early, so other plugins that need to have the full list of
files are aware of what we will be generating.

=head2 prune_files

Files with C<location = root> must also be pruned, so that they don't
sneak into the I<next> build by virtue of already existing in the root
dir.  (The alternative is that the user doesn't add them to the build in the
first place, with an option to their C<GatherDir> plugin.)

=head2 munge_files

=head2 munge_file

Edits the content into the requested README file in the dist.

=head2 after_build

Create the requested README file at build time, if requested.

=head2 after_release

Create the requested README file at release time, if requested.

=head2 get_readme_content

Get the content of the README in the desired format.
