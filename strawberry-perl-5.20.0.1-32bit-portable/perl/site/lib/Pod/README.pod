F<README> file.

syntax that this module recognizes.

The original version was by Robert Rothenberg <rrwo@cpan.org> until
2010, when maintenance was taken over by David Precious
<davidp@preshweb.co.uk>.

In 2014, Robert Rothenberg rewrote the module to use filtering instead
of subclassing a POD parser.
