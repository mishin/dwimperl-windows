HTML::FormHandler::Test - provides is_html method used in tests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.40064

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simple 'is_html' method for testing form rendering against
an expected value without having to fuss with exactly matching
newlines and spaces. Uses L<HTML::TreeBuilder>, which uses
L<HTML::Parser>.

See numerous examples in the 't/render' directory.

   use Test::More;
   use HTML::FormHandler::Test;
   use_ok('MyApp::Form::Basic');
   my $form = MyApp::Form::Basic->new;
   $form->process;
   my $expected = '<form html>';
   is_html( $form->render, $expected, 'form renders ok' );
