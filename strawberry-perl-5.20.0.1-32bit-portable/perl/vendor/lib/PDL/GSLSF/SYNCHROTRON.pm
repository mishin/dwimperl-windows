=head1 NAME

PDL::GSLSF::SYNCHROTRON - PDL interface to GSL Special Functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an interface to the Special Function package present in the GNU Scientific Library. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 gsl_sf_synchrotron_1

=for sig

  Signature: (double x(); double [o]y(); double [o]e())

=for ref

First synchrotron function: synchrotron_1(x) = x Integral[ K_{5/3}(t), {t, x, Infinity}]

=for bad

gsl_sf_synchrotron_1 does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

  Signature: (double x(); double [o]y(); double [o]e())

=for ref

Second synchroton function: synchrotron_2(x) = x * K_{2/3}(x)

=for bad

gsl_sf_synchrotron_2 does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.
