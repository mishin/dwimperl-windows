=head1 NAME

PDL::GSLSF::POLY - PDL interface to GSL Special Functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an interface to the Special Function package present in the GNU Scientific Library. 

NOTE: this should actually be PDL::POLY for consistency but I don't want to get into edits
changing the directory structure at this time.  These fixes should allow things to build.

=for sig

  Signature: (double x(); double c(m); double [o]y())

=for ref

c[0] + c[1] x + c[2] x^2 + ... + c[m-1] x^(m-1)

=for bad

gsl_poly_eval does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.
