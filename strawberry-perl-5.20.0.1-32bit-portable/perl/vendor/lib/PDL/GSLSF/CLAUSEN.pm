=for sig

  Signature: (double x(); double [o]y(); double [o]e())

=for ref

Clausen Integral. Cl_2(x) := Integrate[-Log[2 Sin[t/2]], {t,0,x}]

=for bad

gsl_sf_clausen does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.
