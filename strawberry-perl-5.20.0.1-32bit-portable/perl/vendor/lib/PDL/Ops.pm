=head1 NAME

PDL::Ops - Fundamental mathematical operators

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the functions used by PDL to
overload the basic mathematical operators (C<+ - / *>
etc.) and functions (C<sin sqrt> etc.)

It also includes the function C<log10>, which should
be a perl function so that we can overload it!

Matrix multiplication (the operator C<x>) is handled
by the module L<PDL::Primitive|PDL::Primitive>.
