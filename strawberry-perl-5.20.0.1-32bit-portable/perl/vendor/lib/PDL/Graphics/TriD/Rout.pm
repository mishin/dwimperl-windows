 PDL::Graphics::TriD::Rout - Helper routines for Three-dimensional graphics


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is for miscellaneous PP-defined utility routines for
the PDL::Graphics::TriD module. Currently, there are

=head2 combcoords

=for sig

  Signature: (x(); y(); z();
		float [o]coords(tri=3);)

=for ref

Combine three coordinates into a single piddle.

Combine x, y and z to a single piddle the first dimension
of which is 3. This routine does dataflow automatically.



=for bad

combcoords does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=for ref

Repulsive potential for molecule-like constructs.

C<repulse> uses a hash table of cubes to quickly calculate
a repulsive force that vanishes at infinity for many
objects. For use by the module L<PDL::Graphics::TriD::MathGraph|PDL::Graphics::TriD::MathGraph>.
For definition of the potential, see the actual function.



=for bad

repulse does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=for ref

Attractive potential for molecule-like constructs.

C<attract> is used to calculate
an attractive force for many
objects, of which some attract each other (in a way
like molecular bonds).
For use by the module L<PDL::Graphics::TriD::MathGraph|PDL::Graphics::TriD::MathGraph>.
For definition of the potential, see the actual function.



=for bad

attract does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=head2 contour_segments

=for ref

This is the interface for the pp routine contour_segments_internal
- it takes 3 piddles as input

C<$c> is a contour value (or a list of contour values)

C<$data> is an [m,n] array of values at each point

C<$points> is a list of [3,m,n] points, it should be a grid
monotonically increasing with m and n.  

contour_segments returns a reference to a Perl array of 
line segments associated with each value of C<$c>.  It does not (yet) handle
missing data values. 

=over 4

=item Algorthym

The data array represents samples of some field observed on the surface described 
by points.  For each contour value we look for intersections on the line segments
joining points of the data.  When an intersection is found we look to the adjoining 
line segments for the other end(s) of the line segment(s).  So suppose we find an
intersection on an x-segment.  We first look down to the left y-segment, then to the
right y-segment and finally across to the next x-segment.  Once we find one in a 
box (two on a point) we can quit because there can only be one.  After we are done
with a given x-segment, we look to the leftover possibilities for the adjoining y-segment.
Thus the contours are built as a collection of line segments rather than a set of closed
polygons.
