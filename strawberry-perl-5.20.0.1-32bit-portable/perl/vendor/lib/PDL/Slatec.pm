=head1 NAME

PDL::Slatec - PDL interface to the slatec numerical programming library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PDL::Slatec;

 ($ndeg, $r, $ierr, $a) = polyfit($x, $y, $w, $maxdeg, $eps);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module serves the dual purpose of providing an interface to
parts of the slatec library and showing how to interface PDL
to an external library.
Using this library requires a fortran compiler; the source for the routines
is provided for convenience.

Currently available are routines to:
manipulate matrices; calculate FFT's; 
fit data using polynomials; 
and interpolate/integrate data using piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation.

=head2 Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation (PCHIP)

PCHIP is the slatec package of routines to perform piecewise cubic
Hermite interpolation of data.
It features software to produce a monotone and "visually pleasing"
interpolant to monotone data.  
According to Fritsch & Carlson ("Monotone piecewise
cubic interpolation", SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 
17, 2 (April 1980), pp. 238-246),
such an interpolant may be more reasonable than a cubic spline if
the data contains both "steep" and "flat" sections.  
Interpolation of cumulative probability distribution functions is 
another application.
These routines are cryptically named (blame FORTRAN), 
beginning with 'ch', and accept either float or double piddles. 

Most of the routines require an integer parameter called C<check>;
if set to 0, then no checks on the validity of the input data are
made, otherwise these checks are made.
The value of C<check> can be set to 0 if a routine
such as L<chim|/chim> has already been successfully called.

=over 4

=item * 

If not known, estimate derivative values for the points
using the L<chim|/chim>, L<chic|/chic>, or L<chsp|/chsp> routines
(the following routines require both the function (C<f>)
and derivative (C<d>) values at a set of points (C<x>)). 

=item * 

Evaluate, integrate, or differentiate the resulting PCH
function using the routines:
L<chfd|/chfd>; L<chfe|/chfe>; L<chia|/chia>; L<chid|/chid>.

=item * 

If desired, you can check the monotonicity of your
data using L<chcm|/chcm>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS



=cut




=head2 eigsys

=for ref

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real positive definite symmetric matrix.

=for usage

 ($eigvals,$eigvecs) = eigsys($mat)

Note: this function should be extended to calculate only eigenvalues if called 
in scalar context!

=head2 matinv

=for ref

Inverse of a square matrix

=for usage

 ($inv) = matinv($mat)

=head2 polyfit

Convenience wrapper routine about the C<polfit> C<slatec> function.
Separates supplied arguments and return values.

=for ref

Fit discrete data in a least squares sense by polynomials
in one variable.  Handles threading correctly--one can pass in a 2D PDL (as C<$y>)
and it will pass back a 2D PDL, the rows of which are the polynomial regression
results (in C<$r> corresponding to the rows of $y.

=for usage

 ($ndeg, $r, $ierr, $a, $coeffs, $rms) = polyfit($x, $y, $w, $maxdeg, [$eps]);

 $coeffs = polyfit($x,$y,$w,$maxdeg,[$eps]);

where on input:

C<$x> and C<$y> are the values to fit to a polynomial.
C<$w> are weighting factors
C<$maxdeg> is the maximum degree of polynomial to use and 
C<$eps> is the required degree of fit.

and the output switches on list/scalar context.  

In list context: 

C<$ndeg> is the degree of polynomial actually used
C<$r> is the values of the fitted polynomial 
C<$ierr> is a return status code, and
C<$a> is some working array or other (preserved for historical purposes)
C<$coeffs> is the polynomial coefficients of the best fit polynomial.
C<$rms> is the rms error of the fit.

In scalar context, only $coeffs is returned.

Historically, C<$eps> was modified in-place to be a return value of the
rms error.  This usage is deprecated, and C<$eps> is an optional parameter now.
It is still modified if present.
 
C<$a> is a working array accessible to Slatec - you can feed it to several
other Slatec routines to get nice things out.  It does not thread 
correctly and should probably be fixed by someone.  If you are 
reading this, that someone might be you.

=for bad

This version of polyfit handles bad values correctly.  Bad values in
$y are ignored for the fit and give computed values on the fitted
curve in the return.  Bad values in $x or $w are ignored for the fit and
result in bad elements in the output.

=head2 polycoef

Convenience wrapper routine around the C<pcoef> C<slatec> function.
Separates supplied arguments and return values.                               

=for ref

Convert the C<polyfit>/C<polfit> coefficients to Taylor series form.

=for usage

 $tc = polycoef($l, $c, $a);

=head2 polyvalue

Convenience wrapper routine around the C<pvalue> C<slatec> function.
Separates supplied arguments and return values.

For multiple input x positions, a corresponding y position is calculated.

The derivatives PDL is one dimensional (of size C<nder>) if a single x
position is supplied, two dimensional if more than one x position is
supplied.                                                                     

=for ref

Use the coefficients generated by C<polyfit> (or C<polfit>) to evaluate
the polynomial fit of degree C<l>, along with the first C<nder> of its
derivatives, at a specified point.

=for usage

 ($yfit, $yp) = polyvalue($l, $nder, $x, $a);

=head2 detslatec

=for ref

compute the determinant of an invertible matrix

=for example

  $mat = zeroes(5,5); $mat->diagonal(0,1) .= 1; # unity matrix
  $det = detslatec $mat;

Usage:

=for usage

  $determinant = detslatec $matrix;

=for sig

  Signature: detslatec(mat(n,m); [o] det())

C<detslatec> computes the determinant of an invertible matrix and barfs if
the matrix argument provided is non-invertible. The matrix threads as usual.

This routine was previously known as C<det> which clashes now with
L<det|PDL::MatrixOps/det> which is provided by
L<PDL::MatrixOps|PDL::MatrixOps>. For the moment
L<PDL::Slatec|PDL::Slatec> will also load
L<PDL::MatrixOps|PDL::MatrixOps> thereby making sure that older
scripts work.

=head2 PDL::Slatec::fft

=for ref

Fast Fourier Transform

=for example

  $v_in = pdl(1,0,1,0);
  ($azero,$a,$b) = PDL::Slatec::fft($v_in);

C<PDL::Slatec::fft> is a convenience wrapper for L<ezfftf|ezfftf>, and
performs a Fast Fourier Transform on an input vector C<$v_in>. The
return values are the same as for L<ezfftf|ezfftf>.

=head2 PDL::Slatec::rfft

=for ref

reverse Fast Fourier Transform

=for example

  $v_out = PDL::Slatec::rfft($azero,$a,$b);
  print $v_in, $vout
  [1 0 1 0] [1 0 1 0]

C<PDL::Slatec::rfft> is a convenience wrapper for L<ezfftb|ezfftb>,
and performs a reverse Fast Fourier Transform. The input is the same
as the output of L<PDL::Slatec::fft|/PDL::Slatec::fft>, and the output
of C<rfft> is a data vector, similar to what is input into
L<PDL::Slatec::fft|/PDL::Slatec::fft>.

Calculate the derivatives of (x,f(x)) using cubic Hermite interpolation.

Calculate the derivatives at the given set of points (C<$x,$f>,

The resulting set of points - C<$x,$f,$d>, referred to
as the cubic Hermite representation - can then be used in
other functions, such as L<chfe|/chfe>, L<chfd|/chfd>,
and L<chia|/chia>.

The boundary conditions are compatible with monotonicity,

Calculate the derivatives of (x,f(x)) using cubic Hermite interpolation.

Calculate the derivatives at the given points (C<$x,$f>,
where C<$x> is strictly increasing).
Control over the boundary conditions is given by the 
C<$ic> and C<$vc> piddles, and the value of C<$mflag> determines
the treatment of points where monotoncity switches
direction. A simpler, more restricted, interface is available 
using L<chim|/chim>.

The first and second elements of C<$ic> determine the boundary
conditions at the start and end of the data respectively.
If the value is 0, then the default condition, as used by
L<chim|/chim>, is adopted.
If greater than zero, no adjustment for monotonicity is made,
otherwise if less than zero the derivative will be adjusted.
The allowed magnitudes for C<ic(0)> are:

=over 4

=item *  

1 if first derivative at C<x(0)> is given in C<vc(0)>.

=item *

2 if second derivative at C<x(0)> is given in C<vc(0)>.

=item *

3 to use the 3-point difference formula for C<d(0)>.
(Reverts to the default b.c. if C<n E<lt> 3>)

Set C<$mflag = 0> if interpolant is required to be monotonic in
each interval, regardless of the data. This causes C<$d> to be
set to 0 at all switch points. Set C<$mflag> to be non-zero to
use a formula based on the 3-point difference formula at switch
points. If C<$mflag E<gt> 0>, then the interpolant at swich points
is forced to not deviate from the data by more than C<$mflag*dfloc>, 
where C<dfloc> is the maximum of the change of C<$f> on this interval
and its two immediate neighbours.
If C<$mflag E<lt> 0>, no such control is to be imposed.            

The piddle C<$wk> is only needed for work space. However, I could

Check the given piecewise cubic Hermite function for monotonicity.

The outout piddle C<$ismon> indicates over
which intervals the function is monotonic.
Set C<check> to 0 to skip checks on the input data.

For the data interval C<[x(i),x(i+1)]>, the
values of C<ismon(i)> can be:

If C<abs(ismon(i)) == 3>, the derivative values are
near the boundary of the monotonicity region. A small
increase produces non-monotonicity, whereas a decrease
produces strict monotonicity.

The above applies to C<i = 0 .. nelem($x)-1>. The last element of
C<$ismon> indicates whether
the entire function is monotonic over $x.
