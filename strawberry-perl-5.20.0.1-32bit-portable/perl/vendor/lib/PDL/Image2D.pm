=for ref

2D convolution of an array with a kernel (smoothing)

For large kernels, using a FFT routine,
such as L<fftconvolve()|PDL::FFT/fftconvolve()> in C<PDL::FFT>,
will be quicker.

=for usage

 $new = conv2d $old, $kernel, {OPTIONS}

=for example

 $smoothed = conv2d $image, ones(3,3), {Boundary => Reflect}

=for options

 Boundary - controls what values are assumed for the image when kernel
            crosses its edge:
 	    => Default   - periodic boundary conditions
                           (i.e. wrap around axis)
 	    => Reflect   - reflect at boundary
 	    => Truncate  - truncate at boundary
 	    => Replicate - repeat boundary pixel values



=for bad

Unlike the FFT routines, conv2d is able to process bad values.

=for ref

2D median-convolution of an array with a kernel (smoothing)

Note: only points in the kernel E<gt>0 are included in the median, other
points are weighted by the kernel value (medianing lots of zeroes
is rather pointless)

2D median-convolution of an array in a pxq window (smoothing)

Note: this routine does the median over all points in a rectangular
      window and is not quite as flexible as C<med2d> in this regard
      but slightly faster instead

fast 2D boxcar average

=for example

  $smoothim = $im->box2d($wx,$wy,$edgezero=1);

The edgezero argument controls if edge is set to zero (edgezero=1)
or just keeps the original (unfiltered) values.

C<box2d> should be updated to support similar edge options
as C<conv2d> and C<med2d> etc.

Boxcar averaging is a pretty crude way of filtering. For serious stuff
better filters are around (e.g., use L<conv2d|conv2d> with the appropriate
kernel). On the other hand it is fast and computational cost grows only
approximately linearly with window size.

patch bad pixels out of 2D images using a mask

=for usage

 $patched = patch2d $data, $bad;

C<$bad> is a 2D mask array where 1=bad pixel 0=good pixel.
Pixels are replaced by the average of their non-bad neighbours;
if all neighbours are bad, the original data value is
copied across.

patch bad pixels out of 2D images containing bad values

=for usage

 $patched = patchbad2d $data;

Pixels are replaced by the average of their non-bad neighbours;
if all neighbours are bad, the output is set bad.
If the input piddle contains I<no> bad values, then a straight copy
is performed (see L<patch2d|/patch2d>).

patchbad2d handles bad values. The output piddle I<may> contain
bad values, depending on the pattern of bad values in the input piddle.

=for ref

Refine a list of object positions in 2D image by centroiding in a box

C<$box> is the full-width of the box, i.e. the window
is C<+/- $box/2>.



=for bad

Bad pixels are excluded from the centroid calculation. If all elements are
bad (or the pixel sum is 0 - but why would you be centroiding
something with negatives in...) then the output values are set bad.

Connected 8-component labeling of a binary image.

Connected 8-component labeling of 0,1 image - i.e. find separate
segmented objects and fill object pixels with object number.
8-component labeling includes all neighboring pixels.
This is just a front-end to ccNcompt.  See also L<cc4compt|cc4compt>.

Connected 4-component labeling of a binary image.

Connected 4-component labeling of 0,1 image - i.e. find separate
segmented objects and fill object pixels with object number.
4-component labling does not include the diagonal neighbors.
This is just a front-end to ccNcompt.  See also L<cc8compt|cc8compt>.

Connected component labeling of a binary image.

Connected component labeling of 0,1 image - i.e. find separate
segmented objects and fill object pixels with object number.
See also L<cc4compt|cc4compt> and L<cc8compt|cc8compt>.

The connectivity parameter must be 4 or 8.

=for example

 $segmented = ccNcompt( $image > $threshold, 4);

 $segmented2 = ccNcompt( $image > $threshold, 8);

where the second parameter specifies the connectivity (4 or 8) of the labeling.

ccNcompt ignores the bad-value flag of the input piddles.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

fill the area of the given polygon with the given colour.

This function works inplace, i.e. modifies C<im>.

=for usage

The default method of determining which points lie inside of the polygon used

and edge points. Set the C<Method> option to change this behaviour.

=for usage

  $mask = $img->pnpoly($ps);

  # Old style, do not use
  $mask = pnpoly($x, $y, $px, $py);

For a closed polygon determined by the sequence of points in {$px,$py}
the output of pnpoly is a mask corresponding to whether or not each
coordinate (x,y) in the set of test points, {$x,$y}, is in the interior
of the polygon.  This is the 'points in a polygon' algorithm from
L<http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html>
and vectorized for PDL by Karl Glazebrook.

=for example

  # define a 3-sided polygon (a triangle)
  $ps = pdl([3, 3], [20, 20], [34, 3]);

  # $tri is 0 everywhere except for points in polygon interior
  $tri = $img->pnpoly($ps);

  With the second form, the x and y coordinates must also be specified.

Pixels outside the rotated image are set to C<bg>.

rot2d is faster.

=head2 fitwarp2d

=for ref

Find the best-fit 2D polynomial to describe
a coordinate transformation.

=for usage

  ( $px, $py ) = fitwarp2d( $x, $y, $u, $v, $nf. { options } )

Given a set of points in the output plane (C<$u,$v>), find
the best-fit (using singular-value decomposition) 2D polynomial
to describe the mapping back to the image plane (C<$x,$y>).
The order of the fit is controlled by the C<$nf> parameter
(the maximum power of the polynomial is C<$nf - 1>), and you
can restrict the terms to fit using the C<FIT> option.

C<$px> and C<$py> are C<np> by C<np> element piddles which describe
a polynomial mapping (of order C<np-1>)
from the I<output> C<(u,v)> image to the I<input> C<(x,y)> image:

  x = sum(j=0,np-1) sum(i=0,np-1) px(i,j) * u^i * v^j
  y = sum(j=0,np-1) sum(i=0,np-1) py(i,j) * u^i * v^j

The transformation is returned for the reverse direction (ie
output to input image) since that is what is required by the
L<warp2d()|/warp2d> routine.  The L<applywarp2d()|/applywarp2d>
routine can be used to convert a set of C<$u,$v> points given
C<$px> and C<$py>.

Options:

=for options

  FIT     - which terms to fit? default ones(byte,$nf,$nf)
  THRESH  - in svd, remove terms smaller than THRESH * max value
            default is 1.0e-5

=over 4

=item FIT

C<FIT> allows you to restrict which terms of the polynomial to fit:
only those terms for which the FIT piddle evaluates to true will be

=for sig

  Signature: (img(m,n); double px(np,np); double py(np,np); [o] warp(m,n); { options })

=for ref

Warp a 2D image given a polynomial describing the I<reverse> mapping.

=for usage

  $out = warp2d( $img, $px, $py, { options } );

Apply the polynomial transformation encoded in the C<$px> and
C<$py> piddles to warp the input image C<$img> into the output
image C<$out>.

The format for the polynomial transformation is described in
the documentation for the L<fitwarp2d()|/fitwarp2d> routine.

At each point C<x,y>, the closest 16 pixel values are combined
with an interpolation kernel to calculate the value at C<u,v>.
The interpolation is therefore done in the image, rather than
Fourier, domain.
By default, a C<tanh> kernel is used, but this can be changed
using the C<KERNEL> option discussed below
(the choice of kernel depends on the frequency content of the input image).

The routine is based on the C<warping> command from
the Eclipse data-reduction package - see http://www.eso.org/eclipse/ - and
for further details on image resampling see
Wolberg, G., "Digital Image Warping", 1990, IEEE Computer
Society Press ISBN 0-8186-8944-7).

Currently the output image is the same size as the input one,
which means data will be lost if the transformation reduces
the pixel scale.  This will (hopefully) be changed soon.

=for example

  $img = rvals(byte,501,501);
  imag $img, { JUSTIFY => 1 };
  #
  # use a not-particularly-obvious transformation:
  #   x = -10 + 0.5 * $u - 0.1 * $v
  #   y = -20 + $v - 0.002 * $u * $v
  #
  $px  = pdl( [ -10, 0.5 ], [ -0.1, 0 ] );
  $py  = pdl( [ -20, 0 ], [ 1, 0.002 ] );
  $wrp = warp2d( $img, $px, $py );
  #
  # see the warped image
  imag $warp, { JUSTIFY => 1 };

The options are:

=for options

  KERNEL - default value is tanh
  NOVAL  - default value is 0

C<KERNEL> is used to specify which interpolation kernel to use
(to see what these kernels look like, use the
L<warp2d_kernel()|/warp2d_kernel> routine).
The options are:

=over 4

=item tanh

Hyperbolic tangent: the approximation of an ideal box filter by the
product of symmetric tanh functions.

=item sinc

For a correctly sampled signal, the ideal filter in the fourier domain is a rectangle,
which produces a C<sinc> interpolation kernel in the spatial domain:

  sinc(x) = sin(pi * x) / (pi * x)

However, it is not ideal for the C<4x4> pixel region used here.

=item sinc2

This is the square of the sinc function.

=item lanczos

Although defined differently to the C<tanh> kernel, the result is very
similar in the spatial domain.  The Lanczos function is defined as

  L(x) = sinc(x) * sinc(x/2)  if abs(x) < 2
       = 0                       otherwise

=item hann

This kernel is derived from the following function:

  H(x) = a + (1-a) * cos(2*pi*x/(N-1))  if abs(x) < 0.5*(N-1)
       = 0                                 otherwise

with C<a = 0.5> and N currently equal to 2001.

=item hamming

This kernel uses the same C<H(x)> as the Hann filter, but with
C<a = 0.54>.

=back

C<NOVAL> gives the value used to indicate that a pixel in the
output image does not map onto one in the input image.
