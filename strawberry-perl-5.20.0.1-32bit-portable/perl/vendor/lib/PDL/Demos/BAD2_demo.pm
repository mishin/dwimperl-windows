comment q|
    This demo is just a bit of eye-candy to show bad values in action,
    and requires PGPLOT support in PDL. It makes use of the image of
    M51 kindly provided by the Hubble Heritage group at the
    Space Telescope Science Institute.

    It also serves to demonstrate that you often don't need to change
    your code to handle bad values, as the routines may 'do it' for you.
