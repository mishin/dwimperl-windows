=head1 NAME

PDL::IO::Storable - helper functions to make PDL usable with Storable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Storable;
  use PDL::IO::Storable;
  $hash = {
            'foo' => 42,
            'bar' => zeroes(23,45),
          };
  store $hash, 'perlhash.dat';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Storable> implements object persistence for Perl data structures
that can (in principle) contain arbitrary Perl objects. Complicated
objects must supply their own methods to be serialized and thawed.
This module implements the relevant methods to be able to store
and retrieve piddles via Storable.

=for ref

store a piddle using L<Storable|Storable>

=for example

  $a = random 12,10;
  $a->store('myfile');

freeze a piddle using L<Storable|Storable>

=for example

  $a = random 12,10;
  $frozen = $a->freeze;

=head1 BUGS

The packed piddles are I<not> stored in a network transparent
way. As a result expect problems when moving C<Storable> data
containing piddles across computers.

This could be fixed by amending the methods C<pdlpack> and
C<pdlunpack> appropriately. If you want this functionality
feel free to submit patches.

If you want to move piddle data
across platforms I recommend L<PDL::NetCDF|PDL::NetCDF> as
an excellent (and IMHO superior) workaround.
