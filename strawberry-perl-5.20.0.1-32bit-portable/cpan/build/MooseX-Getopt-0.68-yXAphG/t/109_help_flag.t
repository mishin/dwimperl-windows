# The documentation claims:
#   If Getopt::Long::Descriptive is installed and any of the following command
#   line params are passed (--help, --usage, --?), the program will exit with
#   usage information...

# This is not actually true (as of 0.29), as:
# 1. the consuming class must set up a attributes named 'help', 'usage' and
#     '?' to contain these command line options, which is not clearly
#     documented as a requirement
# 2.  the code is checking whether an option was parsed into an attribute
#     *called* 'help', 'usage' or '?', not whether the option --help, --usage
#     or --? was passed on the command-line (the mapping could be different,
#     if cmd_flag or cmd_aliases is used),

# This inconsistency is the underlying cause of RT#52474, RT#57683, RT#47865.

# Update: since 0.41, usage info is printed to stdout, not stderr.
