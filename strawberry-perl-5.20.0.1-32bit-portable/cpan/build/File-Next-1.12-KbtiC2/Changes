Revision history for File-Next

File::Next does NOT use rt.cpan.org for bug tracking.  Please report
problems at http://github.com/petdance/file-next/issues.

1.12    Sat Dec 22 15:22:31 CST 2012
    [FIXES]
    Fix detection of named pipes under various flavors of BSD.


1.10    Thu Jun 14 19:55:57 CDT 2012
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added the warning_handler argument to File::Next::from_file().
    This is so from_file() can throw a warning if a non-existent
    file is in the file it came from.

    [FIXES]
    from_file() should return undef if the file can't be opened.

    Fixed test failures and made tests more portable.


1.08    Sun May 20 22:43:19 CDT 2012
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added File::Next::from_file() to get the list of files to iterate
    over from a file, or from STDIN.

    Named pipes are now supported.

    [INTERNAL]
    Add more tests, and clean up some Perl::Critic warnings.


1.06    Tue Aug  4 15:10:34 CDT 2009
    [FIXES]
    Fixed closing =cut in POD.

    There are no functionality changes, but the lack of a closing
    =cut meant that ack would not build properly.


1.04    Fri Jul 31 16:24:36 CDT 2009
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    It's never been correct to call File::Next::files() as a method,
    as File::Next->files().  Now, if you do, files() will die with
    an error.  This is also the case with dirs() and everything().
    Thanks to Eric Lyons for reporting.

    Tiny directory reading speedups.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Updated URLs for support sites.

    Added a little note about the follow_symlinks=>0 being a speed
    hit.


1.02    Mon Jan 14 14:01:40 CST 2008
    [SPEED ENHANCEMENTS]
    Don't do a directory stat call if we've already done one to
    check for a symlink.

    Be smarter about building a list of candidate files that we're
    going to have to sort anyway.


1.00    Mon Jun 18 10:06:14 CDT 2007

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added File::Next::everything() to get back everything regardless
    of being file or directory.


0.40    Fri Mar  9 21:32:15 CST 2007

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Minimizing the number of stat calls necessary.  May make some
    teeny speed boost.


    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Fixed the constructor example of File::Next->files, which is wrong.

    Updated the examples to show that you need to check definedness
    of the return from the iterator, in case you get a file "0".


0.38    Sun Jan  7 01:23:43 CST 2007

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added the ability to skip symlinks.  By default, symlinks are
    treated as the files or dirs they point to, but now you can
    tell File::Next to ignore them.

    Added a dirs() function to return an iterator that only finds
    directories.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Fixed some little errors here and there.


0.36    Thu Dec 21 15:50:13 CST 2006

    There is no new functionality between 0.34 and 0.36.  It's
    entirely a speedup.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    I sped up the internals of passing around the queue and building
    paths, and it should now be 20% faster than 0.34 in the simplest
    case.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Now it explains what the iterator returns in list context.

0.34    Sat Dec 16 00:21:10 CST 2006

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    The reslash() function is now publicly usable, although not via
    export.  This is mostly convenience for ack.

    Minor speedups when there's no file_filter parameter.

    Speedups when there's no descend_filter, too.  We were doing
    checks to see if a given file was a directory, even though we
    didn't do anything with that fact if there's no descend_filter.


0.32    Wed Dec  6 19:36:51 CST 2006

    No functionality changes, except as seen below.  For most of
    you using File::Next, there are no changes in this version.

    [INTERNALS]
    Initialize package arrays in BEGIN blocks.  This is so ack's
    standalone version will initialize correctly.


0.30    Fri Nov 10 11:24:50 CST 2006

    [FIXES]
    Explicitly declare $File::Find::name and $File::Find::dir.

    Made the updir/curdir stuff into a hash.

    [FEATURES]
    Added a sort_files parm to allow you to sort the results.

    [INTERNALS]
    Added a perlcriticrc for "make critic".


0.28    Tue Sep  5 23:51:41 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    Wrapped the CORE::die in a real function.  Also added a
    test to make sure that we die properly.

    [INTERNALS]
    Using proper File::Spec function to get the list of special
    directories.


0.26    Sat Sep  2 10:10:12 CDT 2006

    No functionality changes.  Making the tests actually worki
    under Windows this time.  Thanks, Audrey!

0.24    Fri Sep  1 23:38:43 CDT 2006

    No functionality changes.  Only making the tests run under
    Windows.

0.22    Wed Aug 16 14:08:39 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    The file_filter was getting called incorrectly.  I was
    setting $File::Next::file instead of $File::Next::name.

    I've now also added tests to make sure that it's getting
    set correctly.

0.20    Tue Aug 15 02:28:42 CDT 2006

    First real version.  Don't use 0.01 any more.

    Iterator now returns separate file & directory components
    in array context.

    Rewrote internals.

0.01    Sat Jul 29 22:29:46 CDT 2006
    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
