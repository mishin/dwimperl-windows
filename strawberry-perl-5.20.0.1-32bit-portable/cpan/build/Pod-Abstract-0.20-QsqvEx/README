Pod-Abstract

Pod::Abstract provides an abstract, tree-based interface to perl POD
documents. This allows straightforward, round-trip capable
manipulation of POD documents, hence allowing features to be added to
POD to support your programming activities without having to write a
whole POD processor.

This also allows an easy tree-based mechanism to write a Pod::<format>
type filter.

The package includes a simple, and extensible, command line utility
called "paf" (Pod::Abstract Filter). This program can chain together
Pod Abstract filtering operations, allowing manipulation & extraction
of POD documents from the command line.
