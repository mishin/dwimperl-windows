    File::Glob::Windows - glob routine for Windows environment.

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Glob::Windows;
  
      @list = glob($path);
  
      {
          local $File::Glob::Windows::encoding = getCodePage();
          local $File::Glob::Windows::sorttype = 0;
          local $File::Glob::Windows::nocase   = 1;
          @list = glob($path);
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This glob routines works correctly on Windows environment.

    *   Recognize system's current codepage such as 'cp932', It's multibyte
        character contains '\\' and '/' and '*' and '?' in second byte.

    *   Correctly handles current drive and currend cirectory. MS-DOS
        derived environments has current directory for each drive. current
        working directory means current directory on current drive. 'G:'
        means 'G:.' , not 'G:\'.
