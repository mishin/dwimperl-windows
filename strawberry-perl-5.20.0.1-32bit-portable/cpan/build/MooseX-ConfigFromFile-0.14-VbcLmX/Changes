          - configfile value now passed through to new()

            if you override the configfile attribute!

0.07      2013-02-04
          - fixed tests to not load optional dependencies

0.06      2013-02-03
          - the configfile attribute is now a Path::Tiny, not a Path::Class
            (coercions from strings are still supported, and now also from any
            other type that has a string coercion).

0.05      2013-02-03
          - documentation corrected to demostrate how to properly override the
            configfile method to provide a default from the consuming class,
            without having to redefine the attribute itself
          - if MooseX::Getopt is installed, the configfile attribute has the
            Getopt trait applied

0.04      2011-12-17
          - Call the configfile attribute default sub if it is a sub, not just
            a string, just like MooseX::Getopt does (RT#73325, Karen Etheridge)

0.03      2010-12-18
          - The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception
            (Karen Etheridge).
