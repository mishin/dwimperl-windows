NAME
    Devel::Autoflush - Set autoflush from the command line

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
     perl -MDevel::Autoflush Makefile.PL

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a hack to set autoflush for STDOUT and STDERR from the
    command line or from "PERL5OPT" for code that needs it but doesn't have
    it.

    This often happens when prompting:

      # guess.pl
      print "Guess a number: ";
      my $n = <STDIN>;

    As long as the output is going to a terminal, the prompt is flushed when
    STDIN is read. However, if the output is being piped, the print
    statement will not automatically be flushed, no prompt will be seen and
    the program will silently appear to hang while waiting for input. This
    might happen with 'tee':

      $ perl guess.pl | tee capture.out

    Use Devel::Autoflush to work around this:

      $ perl -MDevel::Autoflush guess.pl | tee capture.out

    Or set it in "PERL5OPT":

      $ export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::Autoflush
      $ perl guess.pl | tee capture.out

        and

        only available as part of the full CPANPLUS distribution
