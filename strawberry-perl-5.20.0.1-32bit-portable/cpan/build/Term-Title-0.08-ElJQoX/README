NAME
    Term::Title - Portable API to set the terminal titlebar

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::Title 'set_titlebar', 'set_tab_title';

        set_titlebar("This goes into the title");

        set_titlebar("Title", "And also print this to the terminal");

        set_tab_title("This goes into the tab title");

        set_tab_title("Tab Title", "And also print this to the terminal");

DESCRIPTION
    Term::Title provides an abstraction for setting the titlebar or the tab
    title across different types of terminals. For *nix terminals, it prints
    the appropriate escape sequences to set the terminal or tab title based
    on the value of $ENV{TERM}. On Windows, it uses Win32::Console to set
    the title directly.

    Currently, changing the titlebar is supported in these terminals:

    *   xterm

    *   rxvt

    *   screen

    *   iTerm2.app

    *   Win32 console

    The terminals that support changing the tab title include:

    *   iTerm2.app

USAGE
  set_titlebar
        set_titlebar( $title, @optional_text );

    Sets the titlebar to $title or clears the titlebar if $title is
    undefined.

    On terminals that require printing escape codes to the terminal, a
    newline character is also printed to the terminal. If @optional_text is
    given, it will be printed to the terminal prior to the newline. Thus, to
    keep terminal output cleaner, use "set_titlebar()" in place of a
    "print()" statement to set the titlebar and print at the same time.

    If the terminal is not supported, set_titlebar silently continues,
    printing @optional_text if any.

  set_tab_title
        set_tab_title( $title, @optional_text );

    Has the exact same semantics as the "set_titlebar" but changes the tab
    title.
