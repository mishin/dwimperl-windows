NAME
    Term::EditorEdit - Edit a document via $EDITOR

VERSION
    version 0.0016

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::EditorEdit;
    
        # $VISUAL or $EDITOR is invoked
        $document = Term::EditorEdit->edit( document => <<_END_ );
        Apple
        Banana
        Cherry
        _END_

    With post-processing:

        $document = Term::EditorEdit->edit( document => $document, process => sub {
            my $edit = shift;
            my $document = $edit->document;
            if ( document_is_invalid() ) {
                # The retry method will return out of ->process immediately (via die)
                $edit->retry
            }
            # Whatever is returned from the processor will be returned via ->edit
            return $document;
        } );

    With an "out-of-band" instructional preamble:

        $document = <<_END_
        # Delete everything but the fruit you like:
        ---
        Apple
        Banana
        Cherry
        _END_

        # After the edit, only the text following the first '---' will be returned
        $content = Term::EditorEdit->edit(
            separator => '---',
            document => $document,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Term::EditorEdit is a tool for prompting the user to edit a piece of
    text via $VISUAL or $EDITOR and return the result

    In addition to just editing a document, this module can distinguish
    between a document preamble and document content, giving you a way to
    provide "out-of-bound" information to whoever is editing. Once an edit
    is complete, only the content (whatever was below the preamble) is
    returned

USAGE
  $result = Term::EditorEdit->edit( ... )
    Takes the following parameters:

        document            The document to edit (required)

        separator           The string to use as a line separator dividing
                            content from the preamble

        process             A code reference that will be called once an edit is complete.
                            Within process, you can check the document, preamble, and content.
                            You can also have the user retry the edit. Whatever is returned
                            from the code will be what is returned from the ->edit call

    Returns the edited document (or content if a separator was specified) or
    the result of the "process" argument (if supplied)
