L<Stratopan|http://stratopan.com> is a web service built on Pinto.
Using Stratopan, you can store all your public and private Perl
modules in the cloud without having to create and manage your own
Pinto repository.  Stratopan also has facilities for creating teams of
collaborators, controlling access to your repositories, browsing your
repository contents or revision history, and visualizing your
dependency tree.

At the time of this writing, L<Stratopan|http://stratopan.com> is
still in the alpha stage.  But it is definitely worth investigation.
