DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module implements a parser to convert Pod documents into a simple object
model form known hereafter as the Pod Object Model. The object model is
generated as a hierarchical tree of nodes, each of which represents a
different element of the original document.  The tree can be walked manually
and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise manipulated.  In addition,
Pod::POM supports and provides view objects which can automatically traverse
the tree, or section thereof, and generate an output representation in one
form or another.  The Template Toolkit Pod plugin interfaces to this module.

See the Pod::POM documentation for further details.



STATUS
------

Development of Pod::POM was restarted in March 2009 with the aim of making the
modules comply with perlpodspec.
