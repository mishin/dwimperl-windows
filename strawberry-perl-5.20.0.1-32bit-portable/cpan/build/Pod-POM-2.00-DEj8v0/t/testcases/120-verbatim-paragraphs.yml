# verbatim paragraphs options
---
notes: >
  Verbatim paragraphs consist of lines that are indented.
  A blank line between two indended lines will initially be seen
  as separating the verbatim paragraphs, but the parser will 
  note that the second verbatim paragraphs follows the first
  and will coalesce the paragraphs into a single verbatim block,
  preserving the whitespace on the separating lines.
