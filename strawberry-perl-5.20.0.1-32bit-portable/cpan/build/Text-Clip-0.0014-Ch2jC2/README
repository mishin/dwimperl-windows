DESCRIPTION
    Text::Clip allows you to mark/slice up a piece of text. String matching
    (by regular expression, etc.) is used to place marks. The first mark
    lets you access the text preceding and following the mark. Subsequent
    marks allow you to slurp up the text "clipped" between the marks.
