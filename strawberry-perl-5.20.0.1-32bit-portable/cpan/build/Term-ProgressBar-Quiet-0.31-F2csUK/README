NAME
    Term::ProgressBar::Quiet - Provide a progress meter if run interactively

SYNOPSIS
      use Term::ProgressBar::Quiet;
      my @todo     = ( 'x' x 10 );
      my $progress = Term::ProgressBar::Quiet->new(
          { name => 'Todo', count => scalar(@todo), ETA => 'linear' } );

      my $i = 0;
      foreach my $todo (@todo) {

          # do something with $todo
          $progress->update( ++$i );
      }
      $progress->message('All done');

DESCRIPTION
    Term::ProgressBar is a wonderful module for showing progress bars on the
    terminal. This module acts very much like that module when it is run
    interactively. However, when it is not run interactively (for example,
    as a cron job) then it does not show the progress bar.
